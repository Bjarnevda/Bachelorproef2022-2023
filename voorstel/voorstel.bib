abstract = {In this last chapter, we go beyond neural data science and also largely beyond MATLAB. In the 21st century, data are increasingly logged online, be they existing repositories or recorded de novo. Here, we explore some basic web scraping techniques to open up this world. Specifically, we will interface with an online citation database (PubMed) through an application program interface, retrieving all papers on a given subject and search for a target string, sorted by year. We write code that is able to handle errors because we anticipate inconsistencies in the way data are stored in the database. We then graph our results and make a prediction for the far future.}

abstract="Automated software programs called, ``bots'', are being used extensively to extract, collect and harvest information from the Internet across any website that can be accessed. This unsolicited and intrusive gathering of information, knowns as ``web scraping'' is then subsequently used in a way that can lead to damaging the integrity, authenticity and reputation of the victim website. The problems of web scraping are identified, along with the methods used to prevent the web scraping are explored and explained. Prevention using rate limit detection, identification of automated traffic and known malicious entities are described including the use of honey-potting. The success of using these techniques is concluded by the positive outcome of the results.",
